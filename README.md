This is a farily straightforward page. There are two buttons. 

One lets you add books to your library, which is just storing the object information in an array using a form embedded in dialog.

The other displays all your books along with the information you provided on the 'shelf'. It breaks them into cards and displays them using a wrapped flex container. 

There are a couple of buttons on the cards. One button toggles if you have read the book, adjusting that element's value in the prototype object.
